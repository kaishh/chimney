Chimney is a library for [Scala programming language](https://scala-lang.org)
that provides type classess and DSL for defining transformations between
similar, but different data types with as less boilerplate code as possible.


## Getting started


To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your build.sbt file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.scalaland" %% "chimney" % "0.1.3"
```
or...

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.scalaland" %%% "chimney" % "0.1.3"
```

...if you are using Scala.js.
